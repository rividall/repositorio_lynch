## Amazon Trendforest
Created by Jose Claramonte and Ricardo Vidal Lynch

This is a DataViz showing products purchased during september 2023.
All data was processed using Python and Pandas. Visualization made with
Processing and Adobe Illustrator.

The databse was too heavy for github. You need to download it and manually place it in "/amazonTrendforest/amazonDB" 
(Might need to add it to a gitignore file to prevent you from having trouble when pushing changes)
database at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VMUev3bQAcx1pBEvtsAxUbJJT7mFuAA9/view?usp=drive_link

Database obtained from Kaggle, work in Python based on:
- Aaron Frias's dataset from kaggle.
    - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaronfriasr/amazon-products-dataset/code


Processing code based on:
- Branches are based on 'Cherry Blossom Tree' by Jponcemath on https://openprocessing.org/sketch/441998
- Leaves are based on 'growingTree' by unknown source on https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1589590

The position mapping for the trees was done using the "mapping" Processing code.

The processing directory contains a "trees.zip" files and also a folder named "trees" that contains all images in PDF format.
